We cannot actually import electron from within tests.

The 'solution' is to create mock objects that get imported in their place.

This requires an update to jest.config.js like:

moduleNameMapper: {
  'electron-log': '<rootDir>/module_mocks/electron-log.js',
  'electron': '<rootDir>/module_mocks/electron.js',
}

and the generation of mock objects.

Not ideal ...

and 

does not work with electron-jest runners - needed to be vanilla jest to get it to do the module mapping.
